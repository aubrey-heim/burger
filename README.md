## Description
This project is the thirteenth homework assignment of the UW Coding Bootcamp. For this project I was asked to create an application that would take in burgers and store them in a database which lists the burger name and whether or not they have been devoured. Burgers that have not been devoured are rendered on the left side of the page. When the user selects the “Devour!” button, the burger is moved to the right side of the page. For this assignment, I followed the model-view-controller (MVC) framework and created my own ORMs.
